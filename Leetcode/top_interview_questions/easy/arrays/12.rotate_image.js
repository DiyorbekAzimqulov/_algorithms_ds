// You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image,
// rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
// You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
// DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
