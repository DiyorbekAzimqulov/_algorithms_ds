## When to use DP ?

1. **The first characteristicÂ that is common in DP problems is that the problem will ask for the optimum value (maximum or minimum) of something, or the number of ways there are to do something**. For example:
   - What is the minimum cost of doing...
   - What is the maximum profit from...
   - How many ways are there to do...
   - What is the longest possible...
   - Is it possible to reach a certain point...
2. **The second characteristic that is common in DP problems is that future "decisions" depend on earlier decisions.** Deciding to do something at one step may affect the ability to do something in a later step. This characteristic is what makes a greedy algorithm invalid for a DP problem - we need to factor in results from previous decisions. Admittedly, this characteristic is not as well defined as the first one, and the best way to identify it is to go through some examples.
   To summarize: if a problem is asking for the maximum/minimum/longest/shortest of something, the number of ways to do something, or if it is possible to reach a certain point, it is probably greedy or DP. With time and practice, it will become easier to identify which is the better approach for a given problem.

## Framework for DP problems

To solve a DP problem, we need to combine 3 things:

1. **A function or data structure that will compute/contain the answer to the problem for every given state.**
2. **A recurrence relation to transition between states.**

   - A recurrence relation is an equation that relates different states with each other. Let's say that we needed to find how many ways we can climb to the 30th stair. Well, the problem states that we are allowed to take either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Logically, that means to climb to the 30th stair, we arrived from either the 28th or 29th stair. Therefore, the number of ways we can climb to the 30th stair is equal to the number of ways we can climb to the 28th stair plus the number of ways we can climb to the 29th stair.

     The problem is, we don't know how many ways there are to climb to the 28th or 29th stair. However, we can use the logic from above to define a recurrence relation. In this case, \text{dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)}dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2). As you can see, information about some states gives us information about other states.

3. **Base cases, so that our recurrence relation doesn't go on infinitely.**

   - The equation \text{dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)}dp(i) = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2) on its own will continue forever to negative infinity. We need base cases so that the function will eventually return an actual number.

### Summary

With DP problems, we can use logical thinking to find the answer to the original problem for certain inputs, in this case we reason that there is 1 way to climb to the first stair and 2 ways to climb to the second stair. We can then use a recurrence relation to find the answer to the original problem for any state, in this case for any stair number. **Finding the recurrence relation involves thinking about how moving from one state to another changes the answer to the problem.**
